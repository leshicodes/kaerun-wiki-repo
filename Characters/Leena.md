My character is named Leena. She is a young adult half elf lore bard. 

She was born in nashan (wherever the elf city is on Josie's map) where her elven mother was a noble and a talented musician. Her human father was a healer. 

There was a wolf attack when she was 9 that left her with a slightly crippled foot and her mother died. After her mom died, they moved back to Ventria where her dad was from. 

Her dad basically died emotionally when her mom died, and so Leena was lonely growing up and kind of a care taker for her father. 

She went to bard college and is now beginning to travel the world and learn stories and write poems and songs! She is interested in stories of love and how they have shaped the world: for good or for ill. She's less of a romantic than that would make you think. She is a bit of a romantic, but also just knows that people's is powerful and has changed history.
