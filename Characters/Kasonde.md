### Summary
Kasonde is a "Field Auditor" for the Library of the Unseen Lady, a Lentrian order dedicated to the goddess Ioun. Born in a kingdom defined by its military defense against barbarian hordes, Kasonde developed a militant discipline toward information gathering. He utilizes a telekinetically floating "Codex" and an animated quill to transcribe reality in real-time, filing completed volumes into a meticulous;y organized Bag of Holding. While he enjoys the comforts of a tavern and the company of storytellers, he possesses a cold, violent intolerance for those who attempt to falsify the historical record. He has recently infiltrated the Empire of Ventria alone to document the truth behind Emperor Gorban’s propaganda. It was here, deep behind enemy lines, that he encountered the Half Elf Lore Bard Leena and the disenfranchised noble Malanur Blackstar, forming an alliance of outcasts in a kingdom of lies.

### Description & Personalization
#### Physicality
He possesses the frame of a man who forgets to eat, yet walks twenty miles a day. He is lean, composed of wire and gristle rather than bulk.
- Hands: His most defining feature. His fingertips are stained a permanent, bruising indigo. It does not look like surface dirt; it looks as if the ink has soaked through the dermal layers and entered his bloodstream, a frostbite of knowledge.
- His Tic: His left eye holds a permanent, subtle squint; a muscle memory etched by decades of deciphering faded script in flickering candlelight. When he listens to someone speak, he tilts his head, that squint deepening as if he is physically reading the words hanging in the air.
- His Mark: On the inside of his left wrist, stark against the pale skin, is a tattoo of a single date. It is written in the Lentrian calendar. He does not touch it or speak of it, but when a decision weighs heavy, his gaze drifts there, finding an anchor in the numbers.

#### Attire
- His Coat: Over his armor, he wears a long, heavy duster made of canvas boiled in beeswax. It smells of rain, old parchment, and ozone. It is stiff and waterproof, designed not to keep him dry, but to ensure that if he is caught in a storm, the books beneath it survive.
- The Case: He carries no rucksack. Slung across his back is a square, hard-shelled leather case with reinforced brass corners. It looks like something a diplomat would carry treaties in. It is pristine, contrasting sharply with the dust on his boots.

#### Magic & Effects
- Ink: When Kasonde channels the divine, he does not glow with holy light. The magic manifests as a darkening. The veins in his neck and forearms turn obsidian black, pulsing rhythmically. It looks as though liquid ink is being pumped through his arteries, surging toward his fingertips to rewrite the reality of the battlefield.

- Codex: The book hovers at his shoulder with a heavy, physical presence. It does not bob whimsically; it hangs in the air with the stability of a stone shelf. The quill moves with sharp, staccato jerks; scratch, scratch, stop; mimicking the cadence of Kasonde’s own thoughts.

#### Behavioral Quirk
- His Tell: Kasonde is usually a man of dry wit and active listening. But when a lie is told his change is instant and looming.
    - He stops blinking.
    - He goes perfectly, terrifyingly still.
    - The scratching of the quill cuts off mid word.
    - The Codex snaps shut with a sound like a pistol crack.
    - The quill slowly rotates in the air, aligning itself like a compass needle until the nib points directly at the liar’s throat.
    - He does not shout. He speaks with the quiet, flat affect of a judge reading a sentence.

#### A Moment in the Tavern
*The tavern is loud, a wash of spilled ale and bad violins. Kasonde sits at the corner table, his wax coat dripping rain onto the floorboards. He takes a sip of dark stout, his eyes scanning the room, squinting slightly as if checking the structural integrity of the beams.*

*A local merchant leans over the table, boasting loudly to Leena about how he single handedly fought off three bandits on the river road. Kasonde’s glass pauses halfway to his mouth. The frantic scratching of the quill by his ear stops dead. The book snaps shut, silencing the table.*

*Kasonde lowers the glass. The veins in his hand darken to a bruised violet. He looks at the merchant, his unblinking gaze heavy. "Three bandits," Kasonde says, his voice soft but carrying effortlessly over the din. "Curious. The river road has been closed for repairs for months. And your boots... they have mud from the river valley, not the high road dust."*

*The quill turns, pointing at the merchant’s chest.*

*"Try again. For the record."*

### Character Flaws
Kasonde distrusts moral certainty, seeing confidence without scrutiny as a liability rather than a virtue. He is unsettled by closed questions, divine mandates, and claims of inevitability, preferring doubt over conviction unless certainty has been thoroughly tested.

He forms connections through usefulness rather than emotional openness, expressing care by anticipating needs and solving problems instead of offering reassurance. This makes him reliable but distant, uncomfortable with gratitude or intimacy that lacks a clear function.

He does not fear death so much as being simplified by memory. Having seen people reduced to symbols and stories that erase nuance, he avoids shaping narratives about himself, downplays his role in success, and resists being cast as a hero or authority, believing true understanding is fragile and easily distorted.

#### Discomfort With Moral Certainty
Kasonde is not skeptical of morality. He is skeptical of confidence, seeing it as a blind spot.

What troubles him is not belief, faith, or conviction, but the moment someone decides the question is closed. He has seen too many decisions justified by “there was no other way,” later revealed to have been *the most convenient way.*

He listens carefully to people who believe they are right. Not to debate them, but to locate the moment where doubt should exist and does not.

When certainty appears unexamined, he disengages. When certainty survives scrutiny, he respects it quietly.

##### How it shows
- He asks clarifying questions that feel almost supportive, then stops talking.
- He reacts more strongly to confident mistakes than hesitant ones.
- He becomes visibly uneasy when others invoke inevitability, destiny, or divine mandate as justification.
- He wants to believe some things can be unquestionably right. He just has not seen it often enough to trust it.

#### Intimacy Through Utility
Kasonde was never taught how to be emotionally present without a role.

He learned that being valuable meant being necessary. Anticipating needs. Solving problems before they were voiced. Removing burdens quietly so others could keep moving.

This makes him dependable and difficult to reach.

When someone is hurting, his instinct is to *fix the conditions* around the pain rather than sit inside it. He is uncomfortable when there is nothing actionable to do.

##### How it shows
- He performs acts of care that go unnoticed unless pointed out.
- He becomes awkward when thanked directly.
- He struggles when someone wants reassurance instead of solutions.
- He wants connection, but only understands it when it has edges, tasks, or stakes. Love without function feels unreal to him, even when he wants it.

#### Fear of Being Remembered Incorrectly
Kasonde does not fear death. He fears simplification.

He has seen people reduced to stories that strip out contradiction, doubt, and context. Heroes without hesitation. Villains without reason. Useful lies that make history easier to swallow.

He knows that if he is remembered at all, it will not be as he understands himself.

This makes him careful with words, reluctant to explain his motives, and resistant to anyone shaping a narrative around him.

##### How it shows
- He downplays his role in successes.
- He corrects flattering exaggerations without bitterness.
- He avoids telling stories about himself unless pressed.
- Part of him wants to be known. Another part believes that being known truthfully is impossible, and that trying only accelerates distortion.

### Full Backstory
#### Circumstances of Birth & Cultural Heritage
To be born in Lentria is to breathe air mixed with the dust of the Nadir Steps. It is a kingdom defined by the shield wall; a place where a child learns the sound of a warning bell before they learn a lullaby. He absorbed the grim Lentrian philosophy: that a lie is a crack in the armor, and the man who forgets the past is already dead. He was not forged in fire, but in the cold, unyielding pressure of absolute necessity.

Kasonde was raised in the shadow of this doctrine. He learned that a sword can kill a man, but a forgotten supply line can kill an army. He saw firsthand that the greatest enemy of the state was not the barbarian hoard, but the incompetence of command. The lost map, the forgotten treaty, the ignored scout. While his peers trained to hold the line with iron, Kasonde learned to hold it with ink. He adopted the Lentrian axiom that truth is not a philosophy to be debated, but a tactical asset to be defended.

#### Early Life 
<!-- His induction into the Library was less a schooling and more a forging. The Novitiates of the Unseen Lady were expected to memorize entire genealogies in a single night and recite the tactical failures of the Drenai Wars while under physical duress. Kasonde thrived in the pressure. He possessed a mind that did not just store information; it devoured it. -->
The Library of the Unseen Lady took him in, a boy with eyes too old for his face. It was a place of dust and echoing stone, where the Goddess did not demand prayers, but receipts. The training was a quiet cruelty. Novitiates were forced to transcribe texts until their fingers bled, copying the tactical errors of dead generals until the lessons were burned into their dreams.

Kasonde’s awakening was born of agony. Deep in the freezing scriptorium, his hand cramped into a useless claw, paralyzed by exhaustion. Yet, the history was not finished. He stared at the quill, weeping with frustration, his mind screaming for the ink to flow. And the quill obeyed. It lifted, shivering, and dipped itself into the well, driven not by muscle, but by the sheer, desperate force of his need to witness. In that moment, the boy died, and the Vessel was born. He realized he was no longer a writer; he was the inkwell itself. A scribe who could write a death warrant while looking his target in the eye.

#### Middle & Adult Life
He became a ghost in the courts of the great. For a decade, Kasonde drifted through banquet halls and war rooms, his floating Codex scribbling like a sypmhony of students in the library. He saw the vanity of Kings and the deceit of Queens, recording it all with dispassionate precision.

The turning point came in the study of Duke Alaric. The Duke had commissioned a chronicle of his family’s valor, but Kasonde’s research unearthed a rot at the center of the lineage; a grandfather who had sold secrets to the enemy. When Kasonde presented the finished Codex, the Duke threw a bag of gold on the desk and ordered the chapter burned.

Kasonde did not blink. He simply closed the book. The air in the room grew heavy, the floating quill turning to point at the Duke like a dagger. Kasonde explained that the gold paid for the paper, but the truth belonged to the Goddess. When the Duke drew his sword, Kasonde didn't flinch; he promised that if he died, the Codex would find its way to the High King by morning. The Duke relented, broken by the threat of exposure. Kasonde walked out into the rain, realizing that his pen was dangerous enough to topple dynasties, and that he had the stomach to use it.

#### Starting our Adventure
The Empire of Ventria called to him like a void. It was a kingdom of white marble and white lies, where Emperor Gorban had sanitized the past so thoroughly that the country felt dreamlike and hollow. Kasonde crossed the border alone, a spy in a land of enforced joy.

He found himself in a border tavern, drowning in the suffocating propaganda of the Empire. Then, a melody cut through the noise. He watched Leena, a Half Elf Bard, weaving a song that felt raw and messy and real. It wasn't perfect history; she sang of golden swords where there were only rocks, but it had a pulse.

He approached her, intent on a cold correction, but found himself staying for the warmth. Beside her sat Malanur Blackstar, a man who wore his lost inheritance like a funeral shroud. In the Bard and the Exile, Kasonde saw kindred spirits: three broken things in a kingdom that demanded perfection. He realized that to save the history of this land, he could not just be a witness on the wall. He had to descend into the mud with them.
