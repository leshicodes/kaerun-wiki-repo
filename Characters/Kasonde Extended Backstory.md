### Amara

She was three years younger and twice as brave.

Kasonde remembers her hands more than her face. Calloused palms, split knuckles, a scar across the left thumb from a training accident she refused to explain. When they were children, those hands would drag him out of the library and into the courtyard, forcing wooden swords into his grip, insisting he learn to defend himself. *"Words won't stop a Nadir axe,"* she'd say. *"But a blade might buy you time to run."*

He was terrible at swordplay. She never stopped trying to teach him.

Kasonde visited her once, during a research expedition along the border. She had grown lean and weathered, her laughter rougher than he remembered. There was grey in her hair-just a few strands at the temple, premature, earned. But when she embraced him, she still smelled like home-iron and hearth-smoke and the soap their mother used to make.

She cooked for him that night. A terrible stew, more salt than substance, served in chipped bowls she'd carried from posting to posting for years. He ate two servings and told her it was excellent. She called him a liar and ladled him a third.

*"You're documenting the dead again,"* she said, looking at his Codex with that familiar mix of affection and exasperation.

*"Someone has to remember them."*

*"Someone has to keep them alive first."* She tapped his chest, right over his heart. *"That's my job. Yours is after."*

It was the last conversation they had.

He still has the bowl. Chipped ceramic, glaze worn thin from use. It sits on his desk at the Library, holding ink bottles and spare quill nibs.

He has never washed it. Some nights, when the work goes long and the candles burn low, he imagines he can still smell the salt.

#### The Collapse

The official record states that Thornfeld Garrison fell to a Nadir raid during the winter storms of 1231. A surprise attack. Overwhelming numbers. The garrison held for three days before the walls were breached. Commander Amara Kasonde died leading a countercharge that allowed seventeen civilians to escape through the mountain tunnels.

This is the version carved into the memorial stone in the capital.

This is not what happened.

Kasonde learned the truth six months later, when a supply clerk named Venn arrived at the Library seeking sanctuary. The man was half-mad with guilt, clutching a satchel of documents he had smuggled out of the quartermaster's office.

The documents told a different story.

Thornfeld had sent seventeen requests for reinforcement over the preceding months. Each request was logged, stamped, and filed. None were answered. The garrison's food stores had been requisitioned for a Duke's hunting expedition in the lowlands. Their weapon shipments had been "redirected" to better-supplied outposts closer to the capital. The soldiers who died at Thornfeld did not fall to Nadir savagery. They fell to Lentrian negligence-starved, under-equipped, and abandoned by a command structure more concerned with political convenience than tactical necessity.

The raid was real. But it should have been survivable.

Amara held that wall for three days with half-rations, rusted swords, and the knowledge that no one was coming. She died not because the enemy was strong, but because her own kingdom decided she was expendable.

The supply clerk begged Kasonde to publish the documents. To expose the rot. To give Amara's death meaning.

Kasonde did something worse. He verified them.

#### The Aftermath

He spent four months tracing the chain of requisition orders. He identified the officers who signed the redirections. He found the Duke who commandeered the food stores a man named **Aldric Varn**, whose hunting party had feasted on salted pork while Amara's soldiers ate boot leather and snow.

He compiled everything into a Codex. Sixty three pages. Every signature. Every date. Every lie of omission that led to one hundred and forty-two deaths in a frozen pass.

He did not sleep during those four months. He ate when the quill reminded him, sharp jabs against his shoulder until he acknowledged his own hunger. He spoke to no one except sources. He pursued the documentation with the cold precision of a man performing surgery on himself-cutting, cataloguing, refusing to feel until the work was done.

The feeling came later. It always does.

Then he walked into the office of High Archivist Maren and placed it on her desk.

*"This needs to reach the High King,"* he said.

Maren read it. All of it. Her face did not change.

*"This will destabilize the northern command structure,"* she said. *"Duke Varn has allies. The investigation alone would take years. And the Nadir threat is not diminished-if anything, it grows. We cannot afford a political crisis while the border burns."*

*"My sister is dead."*

*"Many sisters are dead. Many brothers. Many mothers and fathers and children."* Maren closed the Codex gently, as if it were sleeping. *"The question is not whether this truth deserves to be known. The question is whether knowing it will save more lives than it costs."*

Kasonde stared at her. The quill at his shoulder had gone very still.

*"You're asking me to bury it."*

*"I'm asking you to wait. File it. Seal it. Let the political climate shift. In five years, perhaps ten, this can be released without collapsing the alliances we need to survive."*

*"In five years, Varn will be dead of old age. His allies will have rewritten history. My sister will be a name on a stone, and the men who killed her will be heroes."*

Maren met his eyes. She looked tired. She looked like someone who had made this calculation before.

*"Yes," she said. "Probably."*

Kasonde left the Codex on her desk. He walked out of the Library. He did not return for three years.

He spent those years in the field, as far from the capital as he could manage. He documented border skirmishes, plague outbreaks, the oral histories of villages too small to warrant official attention. He told himself it was important work. He told himself the Library needed field auditors more than it needed another voice in the archives.

He did not tell himself that he was running.

The tattoo appeared on his wrist during the first winter. He does not remember getting it. He remembers waking in a roadside inn, his arm aching, the date still raw and red against his skin. **7th of the Frost Moon, 1231**. The day they told him she was dead.

He has never removed it. He has never explained it. When people ask, he says nothing, and his silence is heavy enough that they do not ask again.

#### What Remains

The Codex on Thornfeld still exists. Kasonde filed it himself, eventually-sealed in the Archive's restricted section, marked for review in 1251. Twenty years after her death. Long enough for the politics to cool. Long enough for justice to become archaeology.

He checks the seal every time he returns to the Library. It has never been broken.

Archivist Havel once found him there, standing in the restricted stacks with his hand pressed against the spine of a book he could not open.

*"You did the right thing," Havel said. "The truth will survive."*

*"The truth isn't enough," Kasonde replied. "It was never enough."*

He left for Ventria the following month.

Some days, he wonders if he is documenting Gorban's lies to save a foreign kingdom-or simply because he failed to save his own.

The tattoo on his wrist reads: *7th of the Frost Moon, 1231*.

He does not need the reminder. He has never forgotten.

But forgetting was never the point.

### Darya Vance

He fell in love with her handwriting before he knew her name.

The assignment was routine: establish contact with a Ventrian dissident network operating in the port city of Caphis. The Library had identified a potential asset-a clerk in the Imperial Census Bureau with access to population records, tax documents, and the quiet machinery of state surveillance. Kasonde was to make contact, assess reliability, and cultivate the source for long-term intelligence gathering.

He never met her.

The protocols were strict. Face-to-face contact increased risk of exposure. Instead, they communicated through dead drops-hollowed books left in specific market stalls, letters hidden in the false bottoms of wine crates. She signed her messages with a cipher: "V."

Her first letter was professional. Names, dates, the locations of document caches. The handwriting was cramped and hurried, the script of someone writing in stolen moments.

Her third letter included a joke. A dry observation about the Census Bureau's obsession with categorizing beard lengths for tax purposes. Kasonde read it twice, surprised to find himself smiling.

By the sixth month, the letters had grown longer.

#### What She Wrote

She told him about Ventria in ways the official reports never captured. The fear that lived beneath the marble facades. The way neighbors stopped speaking to each other after the Loyalty Audits began. The children who reported their parents for insufficient enthusiasm during the Emperor's birthday celebrations.

She described the smell of the harbor at dawn salt and tar and the peculiar sweetness of rotting fish-and admitted she found it beautiful, despite everything. She wrote about a stray cat that lived behind the Census Bureau, how she fed it scraps from her lunch, how it was the only creature in Caphis that did not ask her to lie.

She asked about Lentria. He told her about the warning bells, the weight of snow on the mountain passes, the way the Library smelled of dust, candle wax, and centuries. He told her about Amara-the first time he had spoken of his sister to anyone since her death.

*"You carry her with you,"* Darya wrote back. *"In the work. In the precision. She would be proud, I think. Or she would tease you mercilessly. Perhaps both."*

He read that letter seven times. He kept it in his document case, folded into quarters, the creases wearing thin.

#### What He Felt

Kasonde did not know her face. He did not know the sound of her voice, the color of her eyes, the way she held herself when she was tired. He knew her only through ink and paper-through the rhythm of her sentences, the particular slant of her lowercase 'a,' the way she crossed her 't's with a slight upward flourish that suggested defiance or hope or both.

He told himself it was not love. Love required presence, physicality, the accumulation of shared moments. What he felt was professional admiration. Intellectual kinship. The natural affinity between two people engaged in dangerous work.

He was lying to himself. He knew it then. He knows it now.

She was the only person he had ever written to without purpose. The only correspondent whose letters he read for pleasure rather than information. When her messages arrived, he would delay opening them-savoring the anticipation, the knowledge that her words were waiting for him, that someone in a distant city had thought of him and committed those thoughts to paper.

He began drafting responses in his head during meals. He noticed things he wanted to tell her-a particular shade of sunset, a turn of phrase overheard in a tavern, the way the Codex's quill sometimes paused mid-word as if reconsidering. He became a collector of small observations, hoarding them for letters he took too long to write.

Their correspondence deepened through 1242, even as Kasonde began his research into the Verantus family history. He did not know then that the network carrying his letters-the couriers, the dead drops, the careful chain of trust-belonged to Duke Alaric. He did not know that every word he sent to Darya passed through hands that would eventually betray them both.

#### The Silence

The letters stopped in the autumn of 1243.

He waited two weeks before permitting himself concern. Dead drops failed sometimes. Couriers were delayed. The harvest season made travel difficult.

He waited four weeks before sending an inquiry through secondary channels.

He waited six weeks before the reply arrived.

The Ventrian dissident network had been compromised. A purge had swept through Caphis. Fourteen arrests. Eleven executions. The Census Bureau clerk known to the network as "V" had been taken into custody on the 3rd of the Harvest Moon.

She was dead before Kasonde learned her full name.

Darya Vance. Thirty-one years old. Unmarried. No surviving family. She had worked in the Census Bureau for nine years. Her supervisor's report, obtained later, described her as "competent but unremarkable."

Unremarkable.

The word sits in his memory like a splinter that will not work its way out.

---

#### The Letter

Among her effects-seized by the state, then quietly liberated by what remained of the network-was a letter. Addressed to no one. Written in a cipher only Kasonde could read.

It arrived at the Library in the winter of 1243, passed hand to hand through a chain of couriers who did not know what they carried.

He has not opened it.

The letter sits in his document case, beside the transcript that no longer exists and the seal that no longer matters. The paper has yellowed slightly. The wax-plain, unmarked-remains intact.

He tells himself he is waiting for the right moment. A quiet evening. A safe place. The emotional bandwidth to absorb whatever she wanted him to know.

He tells himself these things, and does not believe them.

The truth is simpler and worse: he is afraid.

Afraid that her final words will be a goodbye, and that reading them will make the loss permanent in a way it is not yet.

Afraid that she will have said something tender, and that he will have to live with the knowledge that she felt what he felt, and that it changed nothing.

Afraid that she will have said nothing of significance-just information, just data, just the professional correspondence of a source to her handler-and that the love he remembers was always one-sided, a story he told himself in the margins of her reports.

The letter waits. The seal holds.

Some nights, when sleep will not come, he takes it out and holds it. Feels the weight of the paper. Traces the edges with his ink-stained fingers.

He does not open it.

He is not ready to stop hoping.

---

#### What Remains

Darya Vance does not have a Codex entry.

Her story exists in fragments-the letters Kasonde kept, the intelligence reports she enabled, the gap in the network's communications where her voice used to be. He has considered writing one. A proper accounting. Her name, her life, her death, filed in the Archive where it would survive.

He has not done it.

To write her entry would require reading her final letter. The two acts have become linked in his mind, inseparable. He cannot memorialize her without knowing how she wanted to be remembered.

So she remains undocumented. A gap in the record. The only person Kasonde has ever loved whom the Codex does not contain.

This is, he suspects, its own form of tribute. She lived her life in the spaces between official accounts-in dead drops and coded messages and the quiet resistance of small truths. Perhaps she belongs in the margins.

Or perhaps he is simply a coward, dressing his grief in principle.

He has not decided which.

---

#### The Connection

There is one more thread. One more truth that Kasonde has pieced together in the years since her death.

The dissident network that gave him Darya-the couriers, the dead drops, the funding that kept the resistance alive-belonged to Duke Alaric Verantus.

The Duke had been playing both sides for years. Funding dissidents to gather intelligence, then selling that intelligence to the Empire when it suited him. Using idealists as tools, discarding them when they became liabilities.

The network was compromised six months after the fire. Six months after Alaric fled to Ventria with Kasonde's transcript in his possession. Six months after the Duke needed to purchase his way back into Imperial favor.

Kasonde cannot prove that Alaric sold them. He cannot prove that Darya's name was on a list the Duke handed to the Loyalty Auditors in exchange for sanctuary.

But he suspects.

The suspicion sits in his chest like a stone, cold and unmoving. It wakes him some nights. It sharpens his quill when he writes.

Aldous Verantus was a traitor who killed four thousand soldiers.

Alaric Verantus may be a traitor who killed eleven idealists-and one woman who fed a stray cat behind the Census Bureau and crossed her 't's with a slight upward flourish.

The grandfather's chapter is complete.

The grandson's chapter waits to be written.

And somewhere in Kasonde's document case, next to the evidence he intends to recover and the grief he refuses to release, a letter waits to be opened.

Someday.

Not yet.

---


### The Duke: Alaric Verantus

He met the traitor in a Lentrian drawing room, drinking Lentrian wine, speaking flawless Lentrian dialect. The irony was not lost on Kasonde then. It burns brighter now.

Duke Alaric Verantus is Ventrian by blood, birth, and inheritance-but he has not set foot in his homeland for nineteen years. When Emperor Gorban's father began the purges that would eventually birth the Loyalty Audits, Alaric read the winds with the precision of a man whose family had survived three dynasties by knowing when to leave. He liquidated what he could, bribed whom he must, and fled west with enough gold to purchase a modest estate in the United Human Kingdoms.

Modest, by ducal standards. Three hundred acres of Lentrian farmland. A manor house with seventeen rooms. A wine cellar older than some nations.

He styled himself a refugee. A man of culture displaced by barbarism. The Lentrian nobility, always hungry for exotic tragedy, welcomed him into their salons. He told stories of Ventrian excess and Ventrian cruelty, painting himself as a moderate voice silenced by extremism. He was charming. He was useful. He knew things about the Empire that Lentrian intelligence could not easily obtain.

He was also, Kasonde would eventually learn, still working for Ventria.

#### The Commission

The Verantus chronicle was meant to be simple.

Alaric approached the Library five years ago, requesting a genealogical history of his family. A vanity project-the kind exiled nobles commission to remind themselves they were once significant. The pay was generous. The work was straightforward. Kasonde accepted because the Library encouraged such commissions; they funded the expeditions that mattered.

The research took him into Lentrian archives first. The Verantus family had, over generations, maintained correspondence with Lentrian merchants, diplomats, and-during certain conflicts-military officers. Standard fare for a border-spanning noble house.

Then he found the discrepancy.

A name in a military ledger. A payment recorded in a quartermaster's log. A letter, preserved in the restricted stacks, that should have been destroyed a century ago.

The thread was thin. He pulled it anyway.

##### The Grandfather

Three generations back, the Verantus family tree contained a man named Aldous Verantus. The official histories described him as a diplomat-a bridge-builder who maintained backchannel communication between Ventria and the United Kingdoms during the Territorial Wars. A man of peace.

The documents told a different story.

Aldous Verantus had been a spy. For Lentria. He had sold Ventrian troop movements, supply routes, and fortification plans to the Shield Kingdoms in exchange for gold and guarantees of protection for his western holdings. The intelligence he provided had contributed to at least three Ventrian military defeats, including the Massacre at Solen Fields, where four thousand imperial soldiers died in an ambush they never saw coming.

After the war, when the borders stabilized and memories faded, Aldous had simply... continued. He returned to Ventria. He married well. He raised children. He died in his bed at seventy-three, surrounded by grandchildren who believed their patriarch was a hero of imperial diplomacy.

The truth had been buried in Lentrian archives-filed under a cipher, cross-referenced to nothing, forgotten by everyone except the dust.

Until Kasonde.

#### The Confrontation

When Kasonde presented his findings, Duke Alaric did not rage. He did not threaten. He simply set down his wine glass-Lentrian red, from his own cellars-and said, very quietly, *"This chapter does not need to exist."*

The Codex remained open on the desk between them. The quill had stopped moving.

*"The chapter exists,"* Kasonde replied. *"The question is whether it remains in the final draft."*

*"Then let me be clear."* Alaric leaned forward. His Ventrian accent, usually suppressed, crept into the consonants. *"My grandfather's actions were a response to impossible circumstances. The Empire was losing. My family's survival required flexibility. What you call treason, I call foresight."*

*"Four thousand soldiers died at Solen Fields."*

*"Four thousand Ventrian soldiers. In a war Ventria started, fighting for territory Ventria had no right to claim." Alaric spread his hands-a gesture of reasonableness, of perspective. "My grandfather shortened that war by years. He saved lives. Lentrian lives. Is that not worth something to a Lentrian archivist?"*

The quill rotated slowly, its nib drifting toward the Duke's chest.

Kasonde watched it move. He did not stop it.

*"The truth is not a transaction,"* he said. *"It does not balance lives against lives. It simply is."*

Alaric's eyes followed the quill. When he spoke again, his voice had changed-softer, more careful. The voice of a man recalculating.

*"You are a Field Auditor. You travel. You gather information in places the Library cannot easily reach."* He paused. *"Ventria, for example."*

The quill stopped.

*"I may be an exile,"* Alaric continued, *"but I am not severed. I maintain... relationships. Contacts within the Imperial bureaucracy. Access to documents that do not officially exist. The kind of access that a man in your position might find invaluable."*

*"You're offering me a bribe."*

*"I am offering you a resource. The truth about my grandfather is a century old. The truth about Gorban's empire is being written now, in blood and silence. Which matters more to you, Archivist? A dead man's treason, or a living tyrant's lies?"*

#### The Confrontation

When Kasonde presented his findings, Duke Alaric did not rage. He did not threaten. He simply set down his wine glass-Lentrian red, from his own cellars-and said, very quietly, *"This chapter does not need to exist."*

The Codex remained open on the desk between them. The quill had stopped moving.

*"The chapter exists,"* Kasonde replied. *"The question is not whether it remains in the final draft. The question is how many copies I have already made."*

Something flickered behind Alaric's eyes. Fear, perhaps. Or calculation.

*"My grandfather's actions were a response to impossible circumstances,"* the Duke said. His Ventrian accent, usually suppressed, crept into the consonants. *"The Empire was losing. My family's survival required flexibility. What you call treason, I call foresight."*

*"Four thousand soldiers died at Solen Fields."*

*"Four thousand Ventrian soldiers. In a war Ventria started, fighting for territory Ventria had no right to claim."* Alaric spread his hands-a gesture of reasonableness, of perspective. *"My grandfather shortened that war by years. He saved lives. Lentrian lives. Is that not worth something to a Lentrian archivist?"*

The quill rotated slowly, its nib drifting toward the Duke's chest.

Kasonde watched it move. He did not stop it.

*"You are trying to purchase something that is not for sale,"* he said. *"The truth is not a commodity. It does not negotiate. It does not accept bribes or bow to convenience. Your grandfather was a traitor. That fact will enter the Archive. It will be copied, catalogued, and preserved until the sun burns out and the last reader closes the last book. Nothing you can offer will change that."*

Alaric's composure cracked-just for a moment. His hand moved toward the desk, toward a drawer Kasonde had not noticed before.

*"I am offering you a future,"* the Duke said. His voice had gone flat. Dangerous. *"I have connections you cannot imagine. I can open doors across this continent-or I can close them. Permanently. Consider carefully, Archivist. The Library is not the only institution that keeps records. And some records are better left unwritten."*

Kasonde stood. The Codex snapped shut. The quill settled into its holster at his shoulder like a sword returning to its sheath.

*"You have until morning,"* he said. *"I suggest you use the time to compose your defense. The High Archivist will want to hear it before we forward the documents to the Lentrian Crown."*

He turned and walked toward the door.

Behind him, he heard the drawer open.

#### The Escape

Kasonde woke to smoke.

The manor house was burning. Not the careless fire of an accident-the deliberate, accelerating blaze of arson. Someone had set it in three places simultaneously: the east wing, the kitchens, and the document storage room where Kasonde had been transcribing his final notes.

He made it out through a window, clutching the Codex to his chest, his lungs full of ash and his eyes streaming. The quill had singed its feathers. The leather case containing his research was warm to the touch.

The Duke's carriage was already gone.

By the time the fire brigade arrived, half the manor was rubble. By the time Kasonde filed his report with the Library, Alaric Verantus had crossed two borders. By the time the Lentrian Crown issued a warrant for the Duke's arrest, he had reached Mashphur-and from Mashphur, he had vanished into the one place no Lentrian authority could follow.

He had gone home.

After nineteen years of exile, Duke Alaric Verantus returned to Ventria. And Ventria, it seemed, was willing to take him back.

#### What Was Lost

The chapter on Aldous Verantus survived. Kasonde had made copies, as he told the Duke he would. The truth about the grandfather's treason is now filed in the Archive, cross-referenced and catalogued, available to any scholar with sufficient clearance.

But the grandfather was already dead. Had been dead for a century. His crimes were history-important, damning, but **settled**. The grandfather could not be tried. The grandfather could not be punished. The grandfather was beyond the reach of anything except memory.

The grandson was not.

During their confrontation, Alaric had spoken freely. He had admitted knowledge of his grandfather's treason. He had justified it. He had offered bribes, made threats, and-when Kasonde refused to be moved-revealed the full architecture of his continued dealings with the Empire. Names. Dates. The mechanisms by which a Ventrian exile maintained influence in a court he had supposedly fled.

The Codex had recorded everything.

Kasonde had transcribed the conversation that same night, while the words were fresh. A formal document. Witnessed by his own hand, stamped with the Library's seal, ready to be filed as evidence of conspiracy, attempted corruption of an Archivist, and-most damningly-ongoing collaboration with a hostile foreign power.

That document was in the storage room when the fire started.

It did not survive.

#### The Gap in the Record

Kasonde remembers the conversation. Every word of it. He can recite Alaric's justifications, his threats, the exact moment when charm curdled into menace. The memory is sharp enough to cut.

But memory is not evidence.

The Codex records what happens in its presence. It does not retain information once transcribed-the pages fill, the volumes are filed, and the book begins again. The conversation with Alaric was transcribed, removed, and stored. When the storage room burned, the Codex had already moved on. The words were gone.

Kasonde cannot recreate what he does not have.

He has tried. In the months after the fire, he wrote and rewrote his account of the confrontation. He submitted it to the Archive as testimony, as recollection, as the best reconstruction he could manage.

It was filed under *Disputed Sources*.

High Archivist Maren explained the classification with the patience of someone who had delivered bad news before.

*"Your memory is not in question,"* she said. *"Your integrity is not in question. But the standard for accusation against a foreign noble-particularly one now sheltered by an empire we cannot reach-requires primary documentation. The original transcript, signed and sealed, would have sufficed. Your recollection, however accurate, does not meet that threshold."*

*"He confessed. He admitted everything."*

*"He confessed to you. Alone. In a room that no longer exists, recorded in a document that no longer exists."* Maren folded her hands. *"I believe you. The Archive believes you. But belief is not enough to move crowns and courts. You know this."*

He did know it. He had spent his entire career insisting on exactly this standard. Primary sources. Verified documentation. The unimpeachable weight of ink on paper.

Now that standard was being applied to him, and it found him wanting.

#### What Alaric Took

The Duke did not merely escape. He escaped *with proof of his own confession*.

Kasonde has reconstructed the sequence a hundred times. The fire started in three places. The east wing-a distraction. The kitchens-cutting off the servant's quarters. And the document storage room-where the transcript was filed, awaiting transport to the Library.

Alaric knew where the document was. He knew what it contained. He knew that without it, Kasonde's testimony was merely *testimony*-valuable, but not conclusive. The kind of evidence that could be disputed, denied, buried under counter-accusations and diplomatic complications.

Somewhere in Ventria, Duke Alaric Verantus possesses the only official record of his own treachery. He has the document that would have destroyed him-and as long as he has it, he controls the narrative. He can produce it if he needs leverage. He can destroy it if he needs safety. He can wave it in front of Kasonde's face if he ever wants to twist the knife.

The thought keeps Kasonde awake some nights.

Not the injustice of it. Injustice is familiar. He has documented enough of it to know that the world does not balance its books.

What keeps him awake is simpler: he was *outmaneuvered*.

Kasonde has spent his life believing that the truth, properly recorded, is indestructible.

Alaric taught him otherwise.

#### The Hunt

The official Lentrian position is that Alaric Verantus is a fugitive from justice, wanted for arson, attempted murder, and obstruction of the Archive. The warrant remains active. It will remain active until he is captured or confirmed dead.

The practical reality is simpler: Ventria does not extradite. Emperor Gorban does not answer to Lentrian law. And a man with Alaric's knowledge of both kingdoms-their secrets, their weaknesses, their hidden shames-is far too valuable to surrender.

The Duke is untouchable. For now.

But he is not invisible.

A man of his appetites, his ambitions, his need for significance-such a man leaves traces. Financial records. Political alliances. The testimony of servants and rivals and discarded allies. And somewhere in his possession, locked in a vault or hidden in a secret drawer, is a document bearing Kasonde's own seal. A transcript of a confession that the Duke believes no one else will ever see.

Kasonde intends to find it.

Not merely for justice. Not merely for vengeance. For *completion*.

The chapter on Aldous Verantus is filed and sealed. The grandfather's treason is a matter of record. But the grandson's chapter remains unwritten-a gap in the Archive, a story half-told, a wound that will not close until the final page is filled.

Kasonde requested assignment to Ventria three months after the fire.

#### The Reason

The Library was reluctant. Ventria was dangerous-a totalitarian state where independent scholars were treated as spies and inconvenient truths were capital offenses. The risk was significant. The potential return was uncertain.

Kasonde made his case in writing. Forty seven pages. A comprehensive analysis of the information vacuum surrounding Emperor Gorban's regime, the propaganda structures that maintained it, and the historical atrocities being erased in real time. He argued that the Archive had a duty to document what the Empire was destroying. He argued that the Goddess demanded witness where witness was forbidden.

He did not mention Alaric Verantus.

He did not mention the transcript.

He did not need to. High Archivist Maren had read the fire report. She had seen the warrant. She had filed his testimony under *Disputed Sources* with her own hands. She understood that Kasonde's request was not entirely professional.

She approved it anyway.

*"You are going to get yourself killed,"* she told him, signing the authorization.

*"Probably,"* he agreed.

*"And you are going to find him, aren't you? The Duke. The document."*

Kasonde did not answer. The quill at his shoulder rotated slowly, thoughtfully, as if considering the question.

*"The Archive does not sanction personal vendettas,"* Maren said. *"Whatever you do in Ventria, you do as a Field Auditor. You document. You preserve. You do not-"* she paused, searching for the right word, *"-editorialize."*

*"I understand."*

*"Do you?"*

He met her eyes. The same eyes that had told him to bury his sister's truth. The same voice that had asked him to wait, to calculate, to weigh lives against politics.

*"I understand,"* he repeated, *"that the truth is patient. It can wait for the right moment. It can hide in restricted stacks and sealed files and unopened letters."* He touched the document case at his hip-the case that held Elara's letter, the case that had survived the fire. *"But it does not forget. And neither do I."*

Maren held his gaze for a long moment. Then she looked away.

*"Don't die, Kasonde. The paperwork would be unconscionable."*

#### What Kasonde Knows

Alaric Verantus is in Ventria. The Duke has re-established himself within the Imperial system-his knowledge of Lentrian affairs, his willingness to collaborate, and his family's historical connections have made him valuable to Gorban's regime.

He is no longer a refugee. He is an asset.

The specifics of his current position remain unclear. Kasonde has heard rumors: an advisory role in the Imperial Census Bureau, a seat on some minor council, a quiet estate in the eastern provinces where inconvenient visitors tend to disappear. None of this has been verified. Ventria does not share information willingly, and the Duke has learned to cover his tracks.

But Alaric is not invisible. He cannot be. And somewhere in his possession is a document that belongs in the Archive.

Kasonde intends to retrieve it.

#### What Alaric Knows

The Duke believes he has escaped.

He believes the fire destroyed Kasonde's leverage. He believes the border protects him from Lentrian justice. He believes that time and distance have transformed a dangerous archivist into a minor inconvenience, a name in an old file, a threat that never materialized.

He does not know that Kasonde is in Ventria.

He does not know that the hunt has already begun.

He will learn.

#### What Connects Them

There is one more thread. One more name that binds the Archivist to the Duke, though neither of them knew it at the time.

The dissident network that Kasonde contacted in Caphis-the network that gave him Elara Vance-was not a Library operation. The Library had identified the asset, but the network itself belonged to someone else. A benefactor who funded resistance cells throughout Ventria, who moved money and information through channels the Empire could not trace.

The network belonged to Alaric Verantus.

The Duke had been playing both sides for years. Funding dissidents to gather intelligence, then selling that intelligence to the Empire when it suited him. Using idealists as tools, discarding them when they became liabilities.

Kasonde did not know this when he first contacted Elara. He did not know that the woman he was falling in love with was, in some distant and terrible sense, a piece on a board the Duke controlled.

He knows it now.

The network was compromised six months after the fire. Fourteen arrests. Eleven executions. The purge swept through Caphis like a scythe, and when it was done, Elara Vance was dead.

Kasonde cannot prove that Alaric sold them. He cannot prove that the Duke, fleeing to Ventria with Lentrian authorities on his heels, purchased his safe passage with the names of every dissident in his network.

But he suspects.

The suspicion sits in his chest like a stone, cold and unmoving. It wakes him some nights. It sharpens his quill when he writes.

Aldous Verantus was a traitor who killed four thousand soldiers.

Alaric Verantus may be a traitor who killed eleven idealists-and one woman who fed a stray cat behind the Census Bureau and crossed her 't's with a slight upward flourish.

The grandfather's chapter is complete. Filed and sealed and preserved for eternity.

The grandson's chapter has not yet been written. The evidence has not yet been recovered. The transcript-Kasonde's own words, bearing his own seal-waits in enemy hands.

Kasonde intends to finish it.

All of it.
