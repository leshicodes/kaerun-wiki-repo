Malanur Blackstar : “Mal” : The Thin Pale Duke

His Story So Far:

	The personal details of Malanur Blackstar’s past are a closely guarded secret. His noble blood, however, he makes no attempt to hide. His rightful inheritance, so he claims, is Castle Ormen, one of the oldest fortresses ever constructed by the Dark Elves.

	A noble inheritance was in fact stripped from him by his late father. After embarrassing the family in a way deemed unforgivable, he was passed over in favor of his younger twin sister, Velara. Suspecting (rightly) that her brother would try to have her killed immediately after her father’s passing, she took the initiative. Malanur narrowly escaped assasination. All those within Castle Ormen who had ill feelings towards Velara (and therefore a reason to support Mal) were shown no mercy. Mal was able to escape with a small number of these persecuted supporters, along with a few of his family’s valuables.

	Upon making it to the surface, Mal’s first move was to seek out mercenaries in order to even the odds in the fight against his sibling. This proved more difficult than expected: mercenaries tend to fight for the winning side, and any company large enough to even attempt an expedition into the dangerous Under Dark, let alone take a castle as formidable as Ormen, would cost far more than what he could pay. 

	If Mal could not buy an army, he would forge one. He sought out the bandit clan, which operated out of the mountains to the west of the city-state of Kydor, to make a deal. After hearing him out for a short while, the outlaws seized Mal. His captors presumed to be able to sell him to his sister for a large price. Luckily for Mal, his elven companions successfully snuck into the camp that very night, freeing him. Taking the bandits by surprise, Mal personally dragged the bandit leader from his tent and slew him in front of the rest. To the surprise of all present, he spared the rest. Rather than running again, Mal used a mixture of intimidation and charm to keep control of his new brigand army and began a campaign of banditry.

	Years went by as Mal expanded and strengthened the clan. He earned a reputation for ruthlessness and became something of a local legend: The Thin Pale Duke, after his gaunt, ghostlike appearance as well as his noble airs. Now would be a good time to note that Mal’s appearance is striking amongst his obsidian-skinned kind: he was born snow-white in hair and complexion, as well as pure red irises.

	The wheel of fortune would turn again for Mal when his men intercepted a carriage carrying the priests of some deity he had never known before. They offered information in exchange for their lives: the location of a powerful artifact which they promised would give Mal the strength to overcome his foe. Mal and his men travelled to some of the furthest, most dangerous parts of the world in search of this treasure. Many were lost, and many more deserted. By the time Mal had finally discovered the resting place of this ancient artifact, only two remained at his side. One of his oldest companions from Ormen, and one of the kidnapped priests.

	What was this great power? A suit of armor, made up of hundreds of silver scales and trimmed with gold. As he touched the artifact, a voice entered into his head, promising Mal that if he put on the armor “His greatest enemy will be brought to heel”. Mal wasted no time donning the suit. Upon doing so, he felt he was able  to channel some unknown power into his sword. He struck at the priest who had guided him here, as a means of testing whatever new power he had just acquired. To his shock and dismay, his blade was forcibly stayed inches away from his would-be victim. Mal immediately tried to remove the armor, but could not. It was as if the suit was one with his body. Panicked and enraged, he next attempted to violently grab hold of the priest and demand answers, but found that even this was to no avail. He could not lay a finger on the holy man.
