| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Amara's death | 7th of the Frost Moon, **1231** |
| Kasonde's exile from Library | **1232–1234** |
| Returns to Library, resumes work | **1234** |
| Alaric commission begins | **1242** (five years before 1247) |
| Contact with Ventrian network / first letter from "V" | Late **1241** |
| Correspondence deepens | **1242** |
| Kasonde discovers Aldous's treason | Early **1243** |
| The Confrontation | Spring **1243** |
| The Fire / Alaric's escape | Spring **1243** |
| Network compromised / "V" executed | 3rd of the Harvest Moon, **1243** |

| Kasonde infiltrates Ventria | **1244–1247** |

**Note:** This means Kasonde has been in Ventria for roughly **three years** before meeting the party. That gives him time to have established cover, gathered intelligence, and grown increasingly isolated.
