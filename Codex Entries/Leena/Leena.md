## ENTRY I: INITIAL CONTACT
**Date:** 12th of the Ember Moon, 1247 (Lentrian Calendar)
**Location:** The Gilded Sparrow Tavern, Ventrian Border Province

I found her before I found Blackstar.

She was performing when I entered—a ballad about two lovers separated by a war neither of them started. The lyrics were historically imprecise. The Battle of Sorrow's Gate did not occur in autumn, as she claimed, but in the final weeks of summer. The knight in her song carried a silver lance; the actual commander wielded a halberd.

I almost corrected her publicly. I am grateful I did not.

The song was *wrong*, but the room was *weeping*. Farmers. Merchants. A Ventrian soldier trying very hard to look unmoved. She had taken a footnote from a military history and transmuted it into something that made strangers grieve for people dead three centuries.

This is not falsification. This is something else. I am still determining what to call it.

**Physical Description:**
The subject is a Half-Elf of indeterminate age—the elvish blood makes precision difficult. She possesses the usual markers of mixed heritage: the ears, the angular features softened by human parentage, the eyes that hold light a moment longer than they should.

Beyond this, my notes are inadequate. I have been more focused on what she *says* than what she *looks like*. This is an oversight. The Codex demands completeness.

*Addendum: I will pay closer attention. For the record.*

**Assessment:**
She is a primary source of a different kind than Blackstar. He provides *facts*—names, dates, the architecture of political collapse. She provides *texture*. The emotional climate of a place. The songs people sing when they think no one important is listening.

In Ventria, where Emperor Gorban has made truth a capital offense, the songs in taverns are the only honest census.

She is, therefore, invaluable.

She is also frustrating.

## ENTRY II: THE QUESTION OF EMBELLISHMENT
**Source:** Direct observation over multiple weeks of travel.

The subject embellishes.

This requires clarification. She does not *lie*. The Codex has not flagged a single instance of deliberate falsification. When asked direct questions about verifiable matters, she answers accurately or admits ignorance. She does not invent credentials or fabricate history for personal gain.

But when she *performs*, the facts become... elastic.

**Example One:**
She composed a song about our encounter with a group of Ventrian border guards. In reality, Blackstar intimidated them with a hand on his sword, they decided we were not worth the paperwork, and we passed without incident.

In her version, there was a tense standoff. Blackstar delivered a monologue about the futility of imperial service. One guard reconsidered his life choices. The moment *meant* something.

**Example Two:**
She described a sunset over the Kydorian mountains as "bleeding gold and violet, as if the sky itself was wounded by beauty."

The sunset was adequate. It was orange.

**Analysis:**
I have spent considerable thought on this. My initial instinct was to categorize her embellishments as a form of corruption—a softening of the historical record for aesthetic pleasure.

I was wrong.

She is not corrupting facts. She is *translating* them. She takes the raw data of an event and renders it into a language that humans can feel. The guard checkpoint was, in literal terms, uneventful. But the *tension* was real. The *danger* was real. Her version captured what a dry report would miss: that we were three outlaws passing through the jaws of an empire that would kill us if it knew our names.

The sunset was orange. But we were exhausted, and hunted, and alive for another day. Perhaps it *was* bleeding gold.

I do not approve of her methodology. But I am beginning to understand it.

*Personal Addendum: She asked to read my notes on the checkpoint incident. I declined. She called my account "aggressively beige." I am choosing to interpret this as a compliment to my objectivity.*

## ENTRY III: HER WORK
**Subject Matter:** Love. Almost exclusively.

The subject's compositions focus, with remarkable consistency, on romantic love. Star-crossed lovers. Reunions. Partings. The quiet tragedy of affection unexpressed.

This is not a criticism. It is an observation.

**Hypothesis One:**
She has experienced a significant romantic loss and processes it through her art. This is common among performers. The stage becomes a confessional.

**Hypothesis Two:**
She has *not* experienced such a loss, and her fixation represents a longing for something she has never possessed. The songs are aspirational rather than memorial.

**Hypothesis Three:**
Love is simply what sells in taverns, and she is a pragmatist beneath the poetry.

I do not have sufficient data to confirm any hypothesis. When I asked why she favored love as a subject, she smiled and said, "Because it's the only war everyone has fought."

This is a deflection disguised as profundity. It is also, annoyingly, a good line.

**Open Question:**
Who has she loved? Who has she lost? Or is the question itself a misreading—is she documenting *other people's* loves because her own remains unwritten?

The Codex has a blank page reserved for this answer.

## ENTRY IV: HER ORIGINS
**Source:** None. Subject has not disclosed.

I do not know where she was born.

I do not know why she came to Ventria.

I do not know why a Half-Elf bard with evident talent is performing in border taverns instead of noble courts.

I do not know what she is running from, or toward.

These are significant gaps in the record. Under normal circumstances, I would press for answers. Information abhors a vacuum, and the vacuum surrounding this woman could swallow a library.

But I have learned, in my years of field work, that some sources must be cultivated rather than interrogated. She is not a prisoner to be questioned. She is a companion. The information will come when she is ready to provide it, or it will be inferred from accumulated observation.

*Personal Addendum: I suspect she knows I am documenting her. She has not objected. She may even find it flattering. Bards, in my experience, are rarely opposed to being remembered.*

## ENTRY V: THE PARTNERSHIP
**Nature:** Professional. Complementary. Occasionally Contentious.

We have developed an efficient division of labor:

- I record what *happened*.
- She records what it *felt like*.

In theory, these are parallel tracks. In practice, they intersect more than I anticipated.

**Example:**
We interviewed a Ventrian farmer whose son had been conscripted into the Imperial Legion. I noted the date of conscription, the unit designation, the compensation offered (inadequate), and the father's stated opinion of Emperor Gorban (unprintable).

Leena sat with the man for an hour after I finished. She did not ask questions. She listened to him describe his son's laugh, his fear of horses, the way he used to sing off-key while working the fields.

When she left, she had a song. When I left, I had a report.

His son died at the Siege of Thornwall. My report is in the Archive. Her song is in every tavern between here and Kydor.

I am not certain which document will last longer.

**Assessment:**
She is teaching me something, though I am reluctant to name it. The Codex records truth. But truth is not merely what happened. It is also what it *meant* to the people who lived it.

I am a chronicler of facts. She is a chronicler of souls.

We need both.

## ENTRY VI: OPEN QUESTIONS
The following gaps remain in the subject's file:

1. Place of birth and family history.
2. Training—where did she learn the Lore Tradition? Who was her mentor?
3. Why Ventria? What brought her to the Empire?
4. Has she experienced the love she so frequently documents? If so, what happened?
5. What does she want? Blackstar wants his throne. I want the truth. What does *she* want?
6. Why does she stay with us? We are not safe companions. We are not lucrative. What does she gain from this alliance?

**Status:**
The Codex remains open. The pages reserved for her history remain blank.

I find, somewhat to my surprise, that I am not impatient. The story will unfold in its own time. She is a bard. She understands pacing.

And I have learned, against my every instinct, that some truths are worth waiting for.

## SUPPLEMENTAL NOTE
**Added:** 3rd of the Frost Moon, 1247

She read Entry II without permission.

She did not deny it. She simply appeared at breakfast with a smile and said, "Aggressively beige. I stand by it."

I have added a lock to the Codex.

She seemed pleased by this.
